# breastcancerclassification
Breast cancer continues to be a major worldwide health concern, accounting for millions of new cases diagnosed annually and having a major impact on rates of morbidity and death. Identifying the subtypes of breast cancer in a timely and correct manner is essential for improving patient outcomes, directing therapy choices, and developing personalized medicine strategies. Although machine learning (ML) has shown useful in the classification of breast cancer, new research has indicated that textual data taken from clinical reports and medical literature could be used with traditional numerical features to improve the accuracy of the classification.
Textual data, encompassing clinical notes, pathology reports, and patient histories, provides crucial information for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning in breast cancer cases. The repository offers a comprehensive suite of tools and methodologies, including a robust data preprocessing pipeline tailored for textual data, diverse word embedding techniques such as Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT, and deployment of various deep learning architectures like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or transformers. It provides scripts for model training, validation, and hyperparameter optimization, along with computation and visualization of standard evaluation metrics to assess model performance. Detailed documentation covers dataset sources, preprocessing methodologies, model architectures, training strategies, and usage instructions, while Jupyter notebooks demonstrate end-to-end workflows. Compatibility with popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch ensures flexibility for users to choose their preferred framework. This repository serves as a valuable resource for researchers, healthcare professionals, and developers aiming to enhance breast cancer diagnosis and patient care through the utilization of deep learning techniques on textual data. It emphasizes adherence to ethical guidelines and regulations concerning patient data usage, advocating for patient privacy and confidentiality throughout the model development process.
